# EdTech Platform Implementation Plan - Updated for GraphQL Federation

## Overview

This implementation plan reflects our **GraphQL Federation** architecture with AWS AppSync as the supergraph and microservices providing subgraphs, using **DDD + Clean Architecture + Use Case Pattern**.

**üìÖ PHASE REVIEW COMPLETED**: All phases (0-13) have been comprehensively reviewed and updated to ensure consistency with our latest architectural decisions including:

- ‚úÖ **Phase Numbering**: Clean numeric sequence from 0-13 with all duplicates removed
- ‚úÖ **Presentation Layer**: Renamed from "interfaces" to "presentation"
- ‚úÖ **Unified DTO Approach**: Clear separation between use case request/response and API DTOs
- ‚úÖ **GraphQL Architecture**: Central Lambda resolvers + microservice subgraphs clarified
- ‚úÖ **Expanded Infrastructure**: Complete infrastructure component mapping per service
- ‚úÖ **Use Case Pattern**: Consistent implementation across all services
- ‚úÖ **Domain Events**: Proper event handling and side effects management

## Architecture Summary

### GraphQL Federation Pattern

- **Supergraph**: AWS AppSync (unified GraphQL API)
- **Subgraphs**: Each microservice defines its domain schema
- **Resolvers**: Lambda functions call internal microservice APIs
- **Internal APIs**: HTTP REST with `/internal` prefix

### Core Architectural Decisions

- ‚ùå **No CQRS Pattern** - Use Case pattern with `.usecase.ts` suffix
- ‚úÖ **DDD + Clean Architecture** - Domain-driven with layered approach
- ‚úÖ **NestJS CQRS Integration** - AggregateRoot, events, and sagas
- ‚úÖ **Expanded Infrastructure** - Specific components per service type
- ‚úÖ **Standardized Folder Structure** - Complete microservice organization

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Complex Infrastructure**: Phased approach with infrastructure validation at each step
- **GraphQL Federation Complexity**: Start with simple subgraphs, add complexity gradually
- **Service Dependencies**: Clear dependency mapping and sequential implementation
- **Database Performance**: Implement caching and read replicas early

### Business Risks

- **Extended Timeline**: Realistic estimates with buffer time built into each phase
- **Resource Constraints**: Modular approach allows for team scaling
- **Integration Issues**: Continuous integration and testing at each phase

## üìà Implementation Strategy for Solo Developer

This plan is specifically optimized for **sequential development** with proper **service dependencies** and a **LocalStack-first approach** to minimize AWS costs during development. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a working system at each milestone.

**Key Changes in This Revision:**

- ‚úÖ **All 10 microservices included** (added notification-service, reviews-service)
- ‚úÖ **Proper service dependencies** mapped and sequenced
- ‚úÖ **Use Case pattern** implementation in all phases
- ‚úÖ **Expanded infrastructure components** for each service
- ‚úÖ **Realistic timing** adjusted for increased complexity
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive testing strategy** across all services

**Note**: This plan focuses exclusively on backend services and APIs. Frontend applications (web and mobile) will be developed in a separate monorepo and can be built in parallel once the core backend services reach Milestone 1.

## üîÑ Living Document

This implementation plan is a living document and should be updated as the project progresses and requirements evolve. Each phase document includes detailed task breakdowns, dependencies, and success criteria.
