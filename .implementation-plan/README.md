# EdTech Platform Implementation Plan - Updated for GraphQL Federation

## Overview

This implementation plan reflects our **GraphQL Federation** architecture with AWS AppSync as the supergraph and microservices providing subgraphs, using **DDD + Clean Architecture + Use Case Pattern**.

**üìÖ PHASE REVIEW COMPLETED**: All phases (0-13) have been comprehensively reviewed and updated to ensure consistency with our latest architectural decisions including:

- ‚úÖ **Phase Numbering**: Clean numeric sequence from 0-13 with all duplicates removed
- ‚úÖ **Presentation Layer**: Renamed from "interfaces" to "presentation"
- ‚úÖ **Unified DTO Approach**: Clear separation between use case request/response and API DTOs
- ‚úÖ **GraphQL Architecture**: Central Lambda resolvers + microservice subgraphs clarified
- ‚úÖ **Expanded Infrastructure**: Complete infrastructure component mapping per service
- ‚úÖ **Use Case Pattern**: Consistent implementation across all services
- ‚úÖ **Domain Events**: Proper event handling and side effects management
- ‚úÖ **Admin Security Model**: Superadmin-only admin creation (no promotion mechanism)
- ‚úÖ **Service Boundaries**: Clear User Service vs Tutor Matching Service responsibilities

## Architecture Summary

### GraphQL Federation Pattern

- **Supergraph**: AWS AppSync (unified GraphQL API)
- **Subgraphs**: Each microservice defines its domain schema
- **Resolvers**: Lambda functions call internal microservice APIs
- **Internal APIs**: HTTP REST with `/internal` prefix

### Core Architectural Decisions

- ‚ùå **No CQRS Pattern** - Use Case pattern with `.usecase.ts` suffix
- ‚úÖ **DDD + Clean Architecture** - Domain-driven with layered approach
- ‚úÖ **NestJS CQRS Integration** - AggregateRoot, events, and sagas
- ‚úÖ **Expanded Infrastructure** - Specific components per service type
- ‚úÖ **Standardized Folder Structure** - Complete microservice organization
- ‚úÖ **Superadmin Security Model** - Admin creation restricted to superadmin operations only
- ‚úÖ **Hybrid Service Architecture** - Keep user logic in User Service initially, extract tutor-specific logic later

### Updated Admin Security Model

**Admin Creation Policy**:
- ‚úÖ **Superadmin-Only**: Only platform superadmin can create admin accounts
- ‚ùå **No Promotions**: Admin role cannot be obtained through normal role transitions
- ‚úÖ **System Operations**: Admin creation bypasses normal business rules
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: All admin operations fully logged and traceable

**Security Benefits**:
- **Centralized Control**: Single point of admin access management
- **Attack Prevention**: Eliminates promotion-based security vulnerabilities
- **Compliance**: Clear audit trail for all administrative appointments

### Service Boundary Strategy

**Phase 1 Approach** (Current):
- ‚úÖ **User Service**: Handles ALL user-related logic (including tutor-specific business rules)
- ‚úÖ **Simplified Development**: Single service reduces initial complexity
- ‚úÖ **Solid Foundation**: Comprehensive domain layer with proper patterns

**Future Migration** (Phase 2+):
- üîÑ **Tutor Matching Service**: Extract tutor-specific domain logic
- üéØ **Better Separation**: Specialized tutoring business operations
- üìà **Independent Scaling**: Dedicated tutor service optimization
