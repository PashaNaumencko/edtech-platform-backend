# Step 2: Comprehensive Testing & QA

**Objective**: To ensure the platform is functional, reliable, and performs well under load.

## 1. Integration Testing

-   **[ ] Saga Integration Tests**:
    -   **Goal**: Write end-to-end tests for the most critical distributed flows.
    -   **`BookAndPayForSessionSaga` Test**:
        1.  Set up a test environment with all required services running.
        2.  Use a test client to call the `bookSession` mutation.
        3.  Mock the Stripe webhook call to simulate successful payment.
        4.  Assert that a `Session` record is created in the `communication-service` DB with `CONFIRMED` status.
        5.  Assert that a `Payment` record is created in the `payment-service` DB with `SUCCEEDED` status.
-   **[ ] Federation Tests**:
    -   Write tests to ensure that extending types across service boundaries works as expected (e.g., that the `reviews` field on `TutorProfile` is correctly resolved by the gateway).

## 2. Performance & Load Testing

-   **[ ] Tool Selection**: Use a tool like **k6**, JMeter, or Artillery.
-   **[ ] Scripting**:
    -   Create test scripts for the most common and critical user journeys:
        -   `findTutors` query.
        -   `getCourseDetails` query.
        -   `bookSession` mutation flow.
-   **[ ] Environment**: Run tests against a dedicated, production-like performance testing environment. **Do not run load tests against the actual production environment.**
-   **[ ] Execution & Analysis**:
    -   Start with a low number of virtual users and gradually ramp up to simulate peak load.
    -   Monitor key metrics during the test:
        -   API response times (p95, p99).
        -   Error rates.
        -   CPU and memory utilization of ECS services.
        -   Database connection counts and CPU utilization.
    -   **Goal**: Identify and fix bottlenecks. For example, if the `findTutors` query is slow, it may require a database indexing optimization.

## 3. Functional & User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

-   **[ ] Manual QA Pass**:
    -   Develop a comprehensive QA test plan covering all user stories and features.
    -   Execute the test plan manually across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, mobile).
-   **[ ] Private Beta Program**:
    -   Recruit a small group of target users (e.g., 20-50 students and tutors).
    -   Provide them with access to the staging environment.
    -   Use a dedicated channel (e.g., a Discord server or feedback form) to collect bug reports and usability feedback.
    -   Triage and address critical feedback before launch.
