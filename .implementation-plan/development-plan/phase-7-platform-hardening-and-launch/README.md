# Development Plan: Phase 7 - Platform Hardening & Production Launch

**Objective**: To ensure the platform is secure, reliable, and performant, and to deploy it to a production environment for public launch.

This is the final, non-functional phase that focuses on production readiness. It applies to the entire platform.

## Key Activities

2.  **[Comprehensive Testing & QA](./02-comprehensive-testing.md)**: Validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the platform through rigorous testing.
3.  **[Production Infrastructure](./03-production-deployment-infra.md)**: Define and deploy the production-grade infrastructure using AWS CDK.
4.  **[Production CI/CD Pipeline](./04-production-deployment-cicd.md)**: Automate the testing and deployment process for all services.
5.  **[Monitoring & Alerting](./05-production-deployment-monitoring.md)**: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting to ensure operational visibility.
6.  **[Go-Live Checklist](./06-go-live-checklist.md)**: Outline the final steps for launching the platform to the public.
