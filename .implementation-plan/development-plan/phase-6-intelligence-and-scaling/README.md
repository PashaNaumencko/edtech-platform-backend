# Development Plan: Phase 6 - Intelligence, Analytics & Scaling

**Objective**: To leverage data for improving the user experience and business intelligence, and to introduce AI-powered features that create a competitive advantage.

This phase introduces the `analytics-service` for capturing platform-wide events and the `ai-service` for providing intelligent recommendations.

## Development Steps

1.  **[Analytics Service: Event Capture](./01-analytics-service-event-capture.md)**: Design the data pipeline for capturing and storing events from all other microservices.
2.  **[Analytics Service: Dashboarding](./02-analytics-service-dashboarding.md)**: Implement the process for aggregating metrics and exposing them to an admin dashboard.
3.  **[AI Service: Data Modeling](./03-ai-service-data-modeling.md)**: Set up the infrastructure for creating and storing vector embeddings for recommendation models.
4.  **[AI Service: Recommendations](./04-ai-service-recommendations.md)**: Implement the use cases for generating tutor and course recommendations.
5.  **[AI Service: API](./05-ai-service-api.md)**: Expose the recommendation engines via the GraphQL API.
