# Phase 1: Infrastructure Modernization (Updated Priority)

**Status**: ðŸ”„ **Currently Active** - Aligned with [Architecture Improvement Plan](../ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md)

**Objective**: Execute the infrastructure modernization plan focusing on database migration, cloud environment setup, and unified GraphQL architecture.

**Timeline**: 5-7 days | **Priority**: Critical Foundation Work

## ðŸŽ¯ Updated Phase 1 Priorities

This phase has been updated to align with our [Architecture Improvement Plan](../ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md). The focus is now on foundational improvements that will enable all future development.

## ðŸš€ Infrastructure Modernization Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration (Days 1-2)
**Priority**: ðŸ”¥ **Critical** - Foundation for all services

- **[Database Infrastructure Migration](./01-day-14-database-infrastructure.md)**: 
  - Replace TypeORM with Drizzle ORM
  - Implement mergeObject context for domain mapping
  - Create migration scripts and seeding data
  - Update User Service repository implementations

### Step 2: Cloud Environment Setup (Days 2-3)  
**Priority**: ðŸ”¥ **Critical** - Development environment fidelity

- **[Real AWS Services Integration](./02-day-15-redis-cognito-s3-integration.md)**:
  - Remove all LocalStack dependencies
  - Setup developer-specific AWS environments
  - Implement AWS Secrets Manager for credentials
  - Create environment lifecycle management scripts

### Step 3: Unified GraphQL Architecture (Days 3-4)
**Priority**: ðŸ”¥ **Critical** - API architecture foundation

- **[Hybrid GraphQL Implementation](./03-day-16-eventbridge-event-handlers.md)**:
  - Design AppSync + Federation hybrid approach
  - Implement Lambda resolvers bridging AppSync to Federation
  - Create clear public vs internal API boundaries

### Step 4: Simplified Domain Patterns (Days 4-5)
**Priority**: âš¡ **High** - Code maintainability

- **[Domain Layer Simplification](./04-day-17-internal-http-controllers.md)**:
  - Implement use case services instead of CQRS handlers
  - Setup NestJS CQRS for aggregate roots and domain events
  - Create clean DTO patterns

### Step 5: Service Federation (Days 5-7)
**Priority**: âš¡ **High** - Service mesh completion

- **[GraphQL Federation Setup](./05-day-18-graphql-subgraph-schema.md)**:
  - Add NestJS GraphQL modules to User Service
  - Implement federation directives and resolvers
  - Connect to Apollo Federation Gateway
