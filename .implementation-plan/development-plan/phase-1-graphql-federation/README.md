# Development Plan: Phase 1 - GraphQL Federation & User Service (Remaining Steps)

**Objective**: To complete the implementation of the `user-service` by setting up its infrastructure (database, caching, auth), event handling, and API layers (HTTP and GraphQL), ensuring all components leverage the enhanced domain model.

This plan outlines the technical steps for the remaining work in Phase 1, from Day 14 to Day 20.

## Development Steps

1.  **[Day 14: Database Infrastructure](./01-day-14-database-infrastructure.md)**: Implement PostgreSQL integration with TypeORM, mapping the enhanced domain value objects to the database schema.
2.  **[Day 15: Redis, Cognito & S3 Integration](./02-day-15-redis-cognito-s3-integration.md)**: Implement the remaining infrastructure services for caching, authentication, and file storage.
3.  **[Day 16: EventBridge & Event Handlers](./03-day-16-eventbridge-event-handlers.md)**: Implement the publishing of domain events to EventBridge and create the corresponding handlers.
4.  **[Day 17: Internal HTTP Controllers](./04-day-17-internal-http-controllers.md)**: Expose the service's functionality via internal RESTful APIs for service-to-service communication.
5.  **[Day 18: GraphQL Subgraph Schema](./05-day-18-graphql-subgraph-schema.md)**: Define the public-facing GraphQL API for the `user-service` as a federated subgraph.
6.  **[Day 19: Lambda Resolvers Implementation](./06-day-19-lambda-resolvers-implementation.md)**: Bridge the AppSync supergraph with the `user-service` subgraph using Lambda resolvers.
7.  **[Day 20: Testing & Integration Validation](./07-day-20-testing-and-integration-validation.md)**: Complete all testing to ensure the `user-service` is robust, reliable, and fully integrated.
8.  **[Architectural Decision: GraphQL and Lambda](./08-architectural-decision-graphql-and-lambda.md)**: A document clarifying the hybrid architecture for the GraphQL gateway and microservice implementation.
