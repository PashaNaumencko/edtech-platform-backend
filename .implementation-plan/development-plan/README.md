# EdTech Platform - Development Plan Overview

## üöÄ Current Status: Architecture Modernization Phase

### Active Plan: [Architecture Improvement Plan](./ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md)
We are currently executing a comprehensive architecture modernization plan to address critical technical debt and improve the platform's maintainability, scalability, and developer experience.

**Key Improvements in Progress:**
- **Database Migration**: TypeORM ‚Üí Drizzle ORM for better TypeScript integration
- **Development Environment**: Remove LocalStack, use real AWS services  
- **Simplified DDD**: Use case services instead of complex CQRS patterns
- **Unified GraphQL**: Hybrid AppSync + Apollo Federation architecture
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Simplified saga pattern with EventBridge

## üìã Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Modernization (Current Priority)
**Timeline**: 5-7 days | **Status**: üîÑ In Progress

1. **[Database Migration Strategy](./ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md#11-database-migration-strategy-days-1-2)**
   - Replace TypeORM with Drizzle ORM
   - Implement mergeObject context for domain mapping
   - Create migration and seeding scripts

2. **[Cloud Development Environment](./ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md#12-cloud-development-environment-days-2-3)**
   - Remove all LocalStack dependencies
   - Implement developer-specific AWS environments
   - Setup cost-effective environment lifecycle management

3. **[Unified GraphQL Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md#13-unified-graphql-architecture-days-3-4)**
   - Create hybrid AppSync + Federation approach
   - Define clear public vs internal API boundaries
   - Implement Lambda resolvers bridging AppSync to Federation

### Phase 2: Service Implementation (Next)
**Timeline**: 8-10 days | **Status**: üìã Planned

1. **Simplified Domain Layer Implementation**
   - Implement simplified DDD patterns across all services
   - Use NestJS CQRS for aggregate roots and domain events
   - Remove complex command/query handler patterns

2. **Application Layer with Use Case Services**
   - Replace CQRS commands/queries with use case services
   - Implement clean DTO patterns
   - Setup proper event handling

3. **NestJS GraphQL Federation**
   - Add GraphQL modules to all services
   - Implement federation schemas with proper directives
   - Connect all services to Apollo Federation Gateway

4. **Serverless Lambda Strategy**
   - Define clear Lambda vs Fargate boundaries
   - Implement event handlers as Lambda functions
   - Create AppSync resolver Lambda functions

### Phase 3: Event-Driven Architecture (Future)
**Timeline**: 5-6 days | **Status**: üìã Planned

1. **Simplified Saga Pattern**
   - Implement choreography-based sagas using EventBridge
   - Use DynamoDB for saga state management
   - Create compensation handlers for rollback scenarios

2. **Domain Events & Event Handlers**
   - Implement reliable event-driven communication
   - Create proper event versioning and handling
   - Setup dead letter queues for failed events

3. **Infrastructure Mapping**
   - Implement clean mapping between infrastructure and domain
   - Create mergeObject utilities for complex data mapping
   - Ensure type-safe database operations

- **Developer Experience**: Improved onboarding and productivity

## üîß Development Workflow

### Current Priority Actions
1. **Review Architecture Plan**: [Read the complete improvement plan](./ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md)
2. **Start Phase 1**: Begin with User Service database migration
3. **Remove LocalStack**: Update all development configurations
4. **Simplify Domain**: Implement use case services pattern

### Getting Started
```bash
# 1. Review the architecture plan
cat .implementation-plan/development-plan/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md

# 2. Start with User Service migration
cd apps/user-service

# 3. Install Drizzle dependencies
pnpm add drizzle-orm postgres
pnpm add -D drizzle-kit

# 4. Begin database schema migration
# Follow Phase 1.1 instructions in the improvement plan
```
