## üèóÔ∏è Improved Service Architecture

### 1. Core Business Services (Domain-Focused)

#### `user-service` - Identity & Access Management
**Responsibilities:**
- User authentication and authorization
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook, Apple ID)
- User profile and preference management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

**Database**: PostgreSQL
**Why**: ACID compliance needed for user identity and security

#### `learning-service` - Educational Content Management
**Responsibilities:**
- Course creation, organization, and management
- Lesson structure and content metadata
- Student enrollment and progress tracking
- Learning path management and recommendations

**Database**: PostgreSQL
**Why**: Complex relationships between courses, lessons, and progress need ACID compliance

#### `tutor-matching-service` - Intelligent Matching Engine
**Responsibilities:**
- Tutor profile and expertise management
- Student-tutor matching algorithms
- Availability and scheduling coordination
- Skill graph and relationship modeling

**Database**: Neo4j (skill relationships) + DynamoDB (tutor profiles)
**Why**: Graph database optimal for skill relationships, DynamoDB for profile storage

#### `payment-service` - Financial Operations
**Responsibilities:**
- Dual payment models (per-lesson & full-course)
- Stripe integration and marketplace payments
- Commission handling (20% platform fee)
- Financial reporting and tutor payouts

**Database**: PostgreSQL
**Why**: Financial transactions require ACID compliance and complex queries

#### `reviews-service` - Trust & Quality Management
**Responsibilities:**
- Centralized review system (tutors & courses)
- Rating algorithms and score aggregation
- Content moderation and quality control
- Review analytics and trend analysis

**Database**: PostgreSQL
**Why**: Complex analytics queries and review aggregations

### 2. Communication & Content Services

#### `communication-service` - Unified Real-time Communication
**Responsibilities:**
- Real-time messaging and chat functionality
- Video call orchestration (Agora.io integration)
- Screen sharing and collaboration tools
- Session recording and playback management

**Database**: DynamoDB (messages, metadata) + Redis (real-time state)
**Why**: High-volume messaging needs DynamoDB scalability, Redis for real-time features

#### `content-service` - Media & File Management
**Responsibilities:**
- File upload and storage management (S3)
- Content delivery and CDN optimization
- Media processing and format conversion
- Content versioning and backup strategies

**Database**: DynamoDB (metadata) + S3 (file storage)
**Why**: Scalable metadata storage with direct S3 integration

### 3. Platform Services

#### `notification-service` - Unified Notifications
**Responsibilities:**
- Push notifications (mobile & web)
- Email and SMS notification delivery
- In-app notification management
- User notification preferences and delivery rules

**Database**: DynamoDB
**Why**: High-volume notification queue with fast read/write patterns

#### `analytics-service` - Business Intelligence
**Responsibilities:**
- User behavior tracking and analysis
- Business metrics and KPI monitoring
- Real-time dashboards and reporting
- Data warehouse integration and ETL

**Database**: DynamoDB (event storage) + OpenSearch (analytics)
**Why**: Event stream storage with powerful search and analytics capabilities

#### `ai-service` - Future Enhancement (V2.0)
**Responsibilities:**
- RAG-based learning assistant
- Personalized learning recommendations
- Intelligent content generation
- Learning path optimization

**Database**: OpenSearch (vector embeddings) + DynamoDB
**Why**: Vector similarity search with structured data storage

## üìö Enhanced Shared Libraries

### Core Libraries (Existing - Enhanced)
- **`@app/shared-types`** - Common TypeScript interfaces, enums, and domain types
- **`@app/shared-utils`** - Utility functions, formatters, and helper methods
- **`@app/shared-events`** - Event definitions, event bus abstractions, and patterns
- **`@app/shared-database`** - Database connections, query builders, and ORM utilities
- **`@app/shared-domain`** - Domain primitives, base classes, and common aggregates

### Specialized Libraries (New)
- **`@app/shared-security`** - Authentication utilities, encryption, RBAC helpers
- **`@app/shared-communication`** - WebSocket abstractions, real-time patterns
- **`@app/shared-validation`** - Common validation rules, schemas, and sanitizers
- **`@app/shared-notifications`** - Notification templates, delivery abstractions
- **`@app/shared-analytics`** - Event tracking, metrics collection, analytics utilities

## üîß Architecture Improvements

### 1. Better Domain Boundaries
**Before**: Mixed concerns in single services
**After**: Clear domain separation with single responsibilities

### 2. Improved Scalability
**Before**: Monolithic communication handling
**After**: Dedicated services can scale independently based on load

### 3. Enhanced Maintainability
**Before**: Code duplication across services
**After**: Comprehensive shared libraries reduce duplication

### 4. Technology Optimization
**Before**: Suboptimal database choices for some use cases
**After**: Database per service with optimal technology selection
