# Phase 7: Platform Hardening & Production Launch

**Priority**: Critical (Post-MVP Final Stage)

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective

To ensure the platform is secure, reliable, and performant, and to deploy it to a production environment for public launch. This is the final phase before the platform goes live.

## ðŸ“‹ Dependencies

-   **Prerequisites**: Phase 6 (Intelligence, Analytics & Scaling) must be complete.
-   **Applies to**: The entire platform, including all microservices and infrastructure.

## ðŸ”§ Key Activities

### **1. Security Hardening (Phase 11 in old plan)**

-   **Objective**: To implement comprehensive security measures across the entire platform.
-   **Tasks**:
    -   **Authentication**: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user roles.
    -   **Data Protection**:
        -   Ensure all data is encrypted at rest (database and S3) and in transit (TLS 1.3).
        -   Conduct a review of all services to identify and protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    -   **Infrastructure Security**:
        -   Harden AWS security groups and VPC configurations to restrict all unnecessary access.
        -   Implement container vulnerability scanning in the CI/CD pipeline.
        -   Move all secrets (API keys, database passwords) to AWS Secrets Manager.
    -   **Penetration Testing**: Engage a third party to conduct a full penetration test of the platform.

### **2. Comprehensive Testing & QA (Phase 12 in old plan)**

-   **Objective**: To validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the platform through rigorous testing.
-   **Tasks**:
    -   **Integration Testing**: Write end-to-end integration tests for all critical user flows, especially the `BookAndPayForSessionSaga`.
    -   **Performance & Load Testing**:
        -   Use tools like k6 or JMeter to load test all critical API endpoints.
        -   Simulate peak usage scenarios to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
    -   **Functional & User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
        -   Conduct thorough manual testing of all user journeys across different devices and browsers.
        -   Run a private beta program with a small group of real users to gather feedback.

### **3. Production Deployment (Phase 13 in old plan)**

-   **Objective**: To deploy the platform to a production-grade, highly available infrastructure.
-   **Tasks**:
    -   **Infrastructure as Code (CDK)**:
        -   Create production-ready CDK stacks for all services and infrastructure.
        -   Configure Multi-AZ deployments for all critical components (ECS services, RDS databases).
        -   Set up auto-scaling for all ECS services.
    -   **CI/CD Pipeline**:
        -   Build a full CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) that automates testing, building, and deploying services to production.
    -   **Monitoring & Alerting**:
        -   Configure comprehensive monitoring dashboards in CloudWatch for all services.
        -   Set up critical alerts (e.g., for high error rates, high latency, low disk space) that notify the development team.
    -   **Go-Live**:
        -   Perform the final data migrations and DNS cutover to make the platform publicly accessible.

## âœ… Success Criteria

-   The platform passes a third-party penetration test with no critical vulnerabilities found.
-   All performance and load tests meet the defined targets (e.g., API response times < 200ms under load).
-   The CI/CD pipeline can successfully deploy any service to production with zero downtime.
-   The production environment is stable, monitored, and configured for high availability.
-   The platform is live and accessible to the public.
